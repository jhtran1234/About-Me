# hello-world
This is my first repository. Hello world!

Hi! The year is 2020, and amid the coronavirus pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, I am here learning how to use GitHub. I have been coding since 2012 so this is long overdue, but you know what they say: better late than never!

Currently I am a rising Junior at the University of Maryland - College Park studying Computer Science and Economics. I plan to graduate in May 2022.
